For example, humans make vitamin D because there aren't many food sources of it, but we can't make vitamin C, but can find it in food. But other species can make their own vitamin C.\nIt's a trade off between needing to find a variety of food and not needing the cellular machines to make more stuff.\n\nRuminants like cows are able to extract more nutrients from vegetation than we are, due to their specially adapted digestive system and gut flora.\nRuminants ferment food in their four-chambered stomach over an extended period, which enables their gut bacteria to break down complex carbohydrates, proteins, fiber, which in turn synthesize their own nutrients that the host can absorb.\nAdditionally, ruminants will consume animal bones in order to obtain phosphate and calcium if they're not able to obtain it elsewhere in their diet.\n\nFun fact: We actually still have most of the genes required to synthesize vitamins, such as the gene to synthesize vitamin C which dogs and cats possess, but it is deactivated.\nWhen we started living arboreal lifestyles and consuming a lot of fruit, it was no longer evolutionary preferential to synthesize our own vitamin C- it takes much less energy to absorb it from food, where the plants have already expended the energy to synthesize it- and therefore the gene has gradually grown redundant in chimps and eventually humans.\nThe same has occurred for many other aspects of our genes. Any expense of energy which can be avoided is generally selected against, because individuals who could survive longer with less food were more likely to survive periods of scarcity and thus produce offspring.","created_at":"May 31, 2021 16:29","updated_at":"May 31, 2021 16:33"}},"pageContext":{"slug":"vitamins-in-animals-vs-humans"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2841359383"]}
