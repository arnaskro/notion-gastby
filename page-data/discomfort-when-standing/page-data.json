They work when the skeletal muscles around them contract and release.\nWhen you are walking around, the flexion/relaxation of the walking muscles are literally pumping the blood back to your torso. When you are standing still, you aren't getting that pumping action naturally. You could flex/release your legs intentionally, while standing, but it's not nearly as effective as walking is.\n\nBasically, when you are standing, blood flow slows and \"pools\" in your legs due to gravity. But when you walk, your muscles contract and push the blood in your veins and vessels back up into your upper body.\nOn the side note, seasoned military personnels are able to stand at ease for long periods of time because they are actually swaying back and forth very slowly in micro-movements to contract their muscles and relieve the tingling and numb sensation you get when you keep standing for long periods of time.\n\nHope that makes sense!","created_at":"May 31, 2021 16:29","updated_at":"May 31, 2021 16:32"}},"pageContext":{"slug":"discomfort-when-standing"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2841359383"]}
