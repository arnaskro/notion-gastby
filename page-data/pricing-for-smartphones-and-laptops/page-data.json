Laptops are still notably more expensive. Unless you're say, comparing a middle of the road phone to a low end laptop which isn't really a fair comparison.\nLooking at only big namebrands here to remove extreme outliers.\nA low-end smartphone (Samsung Galaxy A10) might be $120. A low-end laptop (Asus Chromebook C523) might be $240.\nA top-end smartphone (iPhone XS Max) might be $1500. A top-end laptop might be anywhere from $2500 for a more general purpose high-performer (High end macbook pro) or $3200+ for a high-end gaming laptop with a high-end display (ASUS ROG Zephyrus S GX701)","created_at":"May 31, 2021 16:24","updated_at":"May 31, 2021 16:29"}},"pageContext":{"slug":"pricing-for-smartphones-and-laptops"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2841359383"]}
